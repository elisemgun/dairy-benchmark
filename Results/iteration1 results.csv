14/12/2024 12:45,Baseline Agent,What are the most recent bacteria count levels recorded in our quality tests?,"```sql

```
This SQL query retrieves the most recent bacteria count levels recorded in our quality tests. It groups the data by `quality_id` and `batch_number`, selects the maximum `bacteria_count` for each group, and orders the results in descending order based on the maximum bacteria count.

Note that I assumed the `qualitydata` table has a primary key or unique identifier (not specified in the schema), so you may need to modify the query if that's not the case.",0,"Displays all bacteria counts, and the order by should at least have been by date and not max bacteria count. Want just the recent one."

  SUM(productiondata.quantity) AS production_yield
FROM 
  rawmaterialinput
JOIN 
  productiondata ON rawmaterialinput.material_id = productiondata.production_id;
```

This query joins the `rawmaterialinput` and `productiondata` tables on their respective IDs. It then sums up the quantities of input raw materials and output productions, providing a precise yield based on input volume.

Note: The above SQL query assumes that there is a direct relationship between the material ID in `rawmaterialinput` and the production ID in `productiondata`. If this is not the case, additional joins or subqueries might be needed to establish the correct connection.",0,"Near, but should give more insight into the data than just two numbers."

15/12/2024 14:43,Baseline Agent,Have we documented any non-conformities?,"```sql

```

This query retrieves the root causes of deviations by filtering records with a severity that includes the phrase ""root cause"". The results are sorted in ascending order. 

Note: In SQL, it's more conventional to use single quotes around string literals instead of double quotes. Also, be aware that LIKE %...% is case-sensitive; if you want a case-insensitive search, consider using LOWER or UPPER functions on the severity column before comparing it.",0,Too spesific to find any results
