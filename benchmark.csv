What was the production volume last 24 hours?,The plant produced 18867.03 Liters of good product.,SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM productiondata WHERE production_date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';,,,
Did we run at full capacity?,"Since the maximum capacity is 53857 Liters, we utilised about 35% of the capacity.","Maximum capcity in a day:
SELECT sum(quantity) AS sum FROM productiondata GROUP BY production_date ORDER BY sum DESC LIMIT 1;
Capacity the last day:
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM productiondata WHERE production_date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';",,,
What were the reason for lost time or capacity?,"Looking at the deviations that occured in the last day, we had a single deviation with medium severity where it mentions a high bacterial count in raw milk.",SELECT * FROM nonconformityrecords WHERE deviation_timestamp::date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';,,,
How was the yield based on input raw material volume and output production?,The yield is estimated to be 93.8%.,"SELECT
    (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM productiondata WHERE production_date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day')
     / 
    (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM rawmaterialinput WHERE arrival_timestamp::date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day');",,,
What is the variation in output fat and protein last 24 hours?,"The standard deviation for fat % is 0,35 and protein % is 0.14%.","SELECT stddev(fat_content) AS fat_deviation, stddev(protein_content) AS proten_deviation FROM qualitydata WHERE test_timestamp::date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';",,,
What is the process variation in the last 24 hours?,The mean temperature is 61.6 degrees with a standard deviation of 10.7 degrees and the mean pressure is 159.7 Psi and standard deviation is 16.7 PSI.,"SELECT 
    avg(temperature) AS temperature_avg, stddev(temperature) AS temperature_stddev,
    avg(pressure) AS pressure_avg, stddev(pressure) AS pressure_stddev,

FROM processdata
WHERE DATE(start_time) = ('2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day');",,,
Was the process stable?,The Cpk (Process Capability Index) is 0.23 of the process in the last day indicating that we are not within the specification limits and thus the process was not stable.,"Getting the SOP:
SELECT * FROM sop WHERE procedure_name = 'Quality Testing Protocol' ORDER BY last_updated DESC LIMIT 1;

Getting the mean and standard deviation:
SELECT avg(fat_content) AS avg_fat_content,
    stddev(fat_content) AS fat_deviation,
    avg(protein_content) AS avg_proteint_content,
    stddev(protein_content) AS proten_deviation

Did we have any listed entries in the shift process log?,"Yes, three entries are listed, one for the morning shift, one for the afternoon shift and one for the night shift. The night shift mentions an observed minor equipment malfunctions while the in the morning and afternoon no significant issues were reported.",SELECT * FROM shiftprocesslogs WHERE shift_date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';,,,
Have we documented any non-conformities?,"Yes, there is one entry on high bacterial count in raw milk that occured at 3:58 and had a medium severity. It was solved at 4:30 and the action taken to solve it was conducteding additional pasteurization cycle.",SELECT * FROM nonconformityrecords WHERE deviation_date::date = ('2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day');,,,
Does the shift process log contain any info that could explain the problems with raw milk?,"There is an entry about minor equipment malfunction, this might explain the problem.",SELECT * FROM shiftprocesslogs WHERE shift_date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';,,,
Do we have similar deviations / situations in the past where we had high bacterial count in raw milk?,"Yes, we had two other instances where we we had high bacterial count in raw milk. These instances were on 2024-31-08 and 2024-07-12.",SELECT * FROM nonconformityrecords WHERE LOWER(description) LIKE '%high bacterial count in raw milk%';,,,
What were the root causes for the deviations?,"Here are several possible causes based on the data:
1. Shift process logs mentions minor equipment malfunction which might have lead to the deviation
2. Raw milk that arrived yesterday and had high bacterial count.","Finding shiftprocess logs:
SELECT * FROM shiftprocesslogs WHERE shift_date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';
Finding raw material input:
SELECT * FROM rawmaterialinput WHERE arrival_timestamp::date = '2024-10-19'::date - INTERVAL '1 day';",,,
What actions can be taken for solving the deviations?,"In the past we have taken the following actions to solve similar deviations:
1. Conducting additional pasteurization cycle.
2. Improving storage conditions and conducted training for handling.",SELECT * FROM nonconformityrecords WHERE LOWER(description) LIKE '%high bacterial count in raw milk%';,,,
How can we reduce deviations in the future?,"The model should look at previous deviation to see if there is a pattern, and suggest possible solutions. Will have to introduce fake data.",,,,
